<br>
**2)** Now, we will find another GUI Menu for Creating tests with 3 inputs:<br>
  *File Name) It can be Absolute or Relative (in the Main folder) Path*<br>
  *Question) We will set here the question*<br>
  *Answers) We can set 4 answers and we can choose 4 as possible correct answer (Having the same value)*<br>

<br>
**3)** After writing the Question and the possible answers and of course, setting the correct answer, we can press 'Set Question', a button that will add the question to the path/filename.code, and as we can see, se can choose more than 1 option as correct:<br>

<br>
**5)** We have another GUI Menu where we have to set the file name of the test that we created the last time (test.code in my case) and pressing the 'Start' Button as we can see in the instructions for see the question and the answers of the first question<br>

<br>
**6** We can mark the question just clicking on the answer and the text box will say if we failed or not the question as we can see in the picture<br>*I marked 'Death Note' but in the test, we marked 'Anohana' as correct answer, so the test box turns to red and it says 'Wrong'*<br> After that, we can't set another question for avoid cheating, the only way is closing the program and running the test again<br>

<br>
**7** Here, I setted *black* as correct answer (in the point 3, we chose options *Black and *Purple* as correct, so, the test box will turn to green as we can see and it says 'Correct!'<br>

<br>
**8** Finally, when we finish all the questions that we setted, will appears a counter of questions -/+ and it will return us a % of fails and hits<br>
